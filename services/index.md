<img src="/images/iceimage.jpg" alt="image of ice on branch" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" />The Acorn Active Media Foundation is an employee-run tech collective whose members are themselves activists; the projects we work on are chosen based on members' interest in working on them. Our commitment to our clients goes beyond typical business ethics -- we are personally committed to the work that employs us.

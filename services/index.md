People often know what they want to see happen, but not how to get there. Acorn has helped numerous individuals and organizations accomplish their IT development goals. Sometimes, a product or piece of software already exists that will meet your needs; Acorn is not afraid to pass up on a job and recommend a solution that will save you money. Our primary goal is to support those working to build and sustain a more just world -- and we're committed both to fulfilling our clients needs and to lowering their IT development costs.

## Wireless for Business, NGOs, &amp; Municipalities
Implementing wireless to scale is full of marketing hype, confusing technologies and incompatible systems, and countless technical options. Finding the right solution for your needs, whether as a business, non-profit, or municipality, is incredibly difficult. Acorn Active Media's staff can help. We are internationally recognized experts in the field of wireless telecommunications.

## Professional Website Design
Visitors to your website will get their first impression of your organization within seconds of viewing your home page. Make that impression a positive one with professional website design.

Our website design team will organize your content in a way that is highly accessible and intuitive to visitors, that conforms to the latest web standards, and that is aesthetically pleasing.

We understand that your website is about information, not about glamour. Many design firms are only experienced with designing websites for commercial customers who are trying to steer the users towards products. We realize that you want your users to be able to steer themselves to useful information provided by your organization. We're in the business of making useful, usable, organizational websites.

## Organizational Database Development
Every non-profit organization is linked to its data: membership data, donor data, contact information, meeting notes, website content, press releases, supporter information, organizational scheduling, form letters, budget and bookeeping data, and more. Without data, no organization could survive -- data organization has a massive impact how an organization functions.

Unfortunately, many organizations have developed an ad hoc approach to managing important information. We know first-hand what this is like -- Acorn staff have extensive hands-on experience coordinating not-for-profit organizations and community campaigns. We can help you organize your information so that you are more efficient and flexible -- we focus on what you do, how you do it, and why you do it that particular way. We work with you to develop web technologies and content management systems that will fit your needs. We then implement a custom data management solution for you. At every step of the process we will work with your organization to ensure that the end product is something that will make your work easier and more efficient.

## Web Application Development
Acorn Active Media is a collective of designers, programmers, and human interface experts. With our collective expertise we are able to realize any web application that you can dream of. We can make it highly usable, function packed, and beautiful. If you would like to serve your target audience by providing some service online, we can help you do that.

Whether you know exactly what you want or just have a dream, our design team can work with you to understand and document your requirements.
